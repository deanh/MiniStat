== DESCRIPTION:
  
This is a simple package that generates simple statistical info on
numerical data sets of a single variable. It's nothing too fancy, but
maybe just enough to coat your numbers with a thin layer of science. Or,
at least to get you thinking about what it may take to do so.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Pure Ruby
* It's small and simple
* It's probably good enough
* I haven't profiled it against large data sets
* Naive median implementation requires a sort, but it could be done in linear time. Patches welcome.
* Missing tests for harmonic and geometric mean -- the stats package I was generating test data with didn't have them.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'ministat'
 
  data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,6,5,4,4]
  puts MiniStat::Data.new(data).to_s

== REQUIREMENTS:

  Hoe
